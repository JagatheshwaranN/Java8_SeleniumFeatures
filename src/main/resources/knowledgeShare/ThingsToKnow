Selenium Framework OOPS concepts
==================================
1. Interface - WebDriver, WebElement, WebElements, JavaScriptExecutor and Alert.
2. Polymorphism - Method overloading - WebDriverWait | Method overriding - Instantiation of Driver based
   on runtime browser driver implementation class.
3. Encapsulation - In POM framework, we used to declare the locators in page level as private members and 
   access the same using the getter and setter.
4. Abstraction - In POM framework, we used to declare the locators as Private and its implementation is not
   viewed by the test class.
5. Inheritance - When we want to reuse the methods of class 1 in class 2 then it will be done with extends 
   keyword.

Difference B/W BIDI API and CDP
===============================
1. CDP focus on chromium based browsers (Chrome)
2. BIDI API focus for all browser vendros
