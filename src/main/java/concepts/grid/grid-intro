Grid Intro
==========

Why Grid?
=========
I need a tool to run the test suite in parallel.
How can I reduce the time for completion of the test suite.

What is Grid?
=============
Allows us to execute test script on different machines at the same time.

Execution is possible on:
=========================
1. Different machines with different browsers.
2. Same browser with different versions.

It saves a lot of time  and effort for execution.

It consists of Hub and multiple Nodes.
1. Hub works as a central point controlling all the nodes.
2. Nodes are actual machines on which execution is done.

How Selenium Grid Works
=======================
It works based on Hub and Node concept. It is the majorly used approach as well.

                          Hub
                           |
----------------------------------------------------------
|               |                 |             |
Node1           Node2             Node3         Node4
Firefox         Edge              Safari        Chrome
on Ubuntu       on Windows        on Mac        on Android

Hub &  Node
===========
Hub
===
1. Central point where you load the tests.
2. Only one hub in a grid.
3. Launched only on a single machine.

Node
====
1. Selenium instances that will executes the tests.
2. One or More nodes in a grid.
3. Launched on multiple machines with different platforms and browsers.

Hands-on Pre-requisites
=======================
1. Download and keep the Selenium-server-standalone.jar file.
2. Suggested to place the above jar file at the same location as your CWD.

Things to Remember
==================
When you are going for grid setup, please make sure that the firewall setting
is turned off.

Start a Hub
===========
java -jar selenium-server-4.16.1.jar hub

By default, the Hub will run on http://192.168.1.5:"4444" port. To change the
port,
java -jar selenium-server-4.16.1.jar hub -port 4441

Netstat -a -> To get the list of ports used.

Start a Node
============
java -jar selenium-server-4.16.1.jar node

Running tests using Grid
========================



Selenium Server Commands
========================
A list of all the commands available. To use one, run 'java -jar selenium.jar
commandName'.

  completion    Generate shell autocompletion
  distributor   Adds this server as the distributor in a selenium grid.
  hub           A grid hub, composed of sessions, distributor, and router.
  info          Prints information for commands and topics.
  node          Adds this server as a Node in the Selenium Grid.
  router        Creates a router to front the selenium grid.
