SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)
==============================
The SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) element in HTML is used to embed SVG graphics directly
into an HTML document. SVG is a markup language for describing two-dimensional graphics in
XML format. It allows for the creation of vector graphics that can scale smoothly regardless
of the size of the display or the resolution of the printing device.

The <svg> element is the root element of an SVG image. It can contain various other SVG
elements such as shapes (e.g., <circle>, <rect>, <path>), text (<text>), images (<image>),
and more. Additionally, SVG elements can be styled using CSS and manipulated using JavaScript
for dynamic effects.

The  <svg> element in HTML is the foundation for embedding Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)
into your webpages. SVG offers a powerful and versatile way to create vector-based graphics
that maintain quality when resized or zoomed.

Here's a breakdown of the <svg> element:
========================================
1. Container: It acts as a container for all your SVG elements, defining a new coordinate system
and viewport for your graphics.

2. Scalability: Unlike raster images (like JPEGs), SVG graphics are vector-based, meaning they use
mathematical formulas to represent shapes and lines. This allows them to scale infinitely without
losing quality.

3. Rich Graphics: Using SVG, you can create various graphic elements including paths, shapes
(rectangles, circles, etc.), text, and even integrate raster images.

Embedding SVG in HTML:
======================
The <svg> element can be used in two ways:

As the root element of an SVG document: This is useful for creating standalone SVG files.
Embedded within an HTML document: This is the most common way to use SVG in web development. You
can place the <svg> element anywhere within your HTML code, like you would any other HTML element.
To ensure proper rendering within HTML, the <svg> element typically includes attributes like:

1. width: Defines the width of the SVG graphic.
2. height: Defines the height of the SVG graphic.
3. xmlns: This attribute specifies the SVG namespace, which is important for browsers to recognize
the element as SVG.
