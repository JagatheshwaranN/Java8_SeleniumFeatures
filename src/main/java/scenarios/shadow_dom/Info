Shadow DOM
==========
The Shadow DOM (Document Object Model) is a feature of web browsers that allows developers
to encapsulate the structure and styles of a component, keeping them separate from the rest
of the document.

Imagine you have a web page with different sections and elements. Each element, such as
buttons, input fields, or custom components, has its own set of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
code. Now, if you want to create a component that behaves like a button but has a unique
style and functionality, you can use the Shadow DOM.

Here's a simple analogy: think of a house. The main document is like the outside of the house,
where you see the walls, windows, and doors. Inside the house, you have rooms. Each room is
like a Shadow DOM. It's a space where you can put furniture, paint the walls differently, and
customize the decor without affecting the rest of the house.

In web development, the Shadow DOM works similarly. It allows you to create components with
their own HTML structure, CSS styles, and JavaScript behavior, all contained within a boundary,
so they don't interfere with other elements on the page. This way, you can build modular,
reusable components that are easier to manage and maintain.

Shadow Host: The Shadow Host is an element in the main document to which the Shadow DOM is
attached. It serves as the entry point or container for the Shadow DOM subtree. The Shadow
Host can contain regular DOM elements as well as Shadow DOM elements.

Shadow Tree: The Shadow Tree is the internal structure created by the Shadow DOM. It consists
of the elements, styles, and behavior encapsulated within the Shadow DOM. This Shadow Tree is
separate from the main document's DOM tree, providing encapsulation and isolation.

Shadow Root: The Shadow Root is the root node of the Shadow Tree. It serves as the starting
point for the internal structure of the Shadow DOM. The Shadow Root is attached to the Shadow
Host element, forming a boundary between the main document and the encapsulated content of
the Shadow DOM.

Boundary: The Boundary refers to the separation between the main document's DOM tree and the
Shadow Tree created by the Shadow DOM. This boundary ensures that the encapsulated content
within the Shadow DOM remains isolated from the rest of the document, preventing styles and
behavior from leaking out and affecting other elements.

In summary,
Shadow HOST: The regular DOM node that the Shadow DOM is attached to.
Shadow TREE: The DOM tree inside the Shadow DOM.
Shadow BOUNDARY: The place where the Shadow DOM ends, and the regular DOM begins.
Shadow ROOT: The root node of the Shadow tree.
